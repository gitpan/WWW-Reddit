WWW-Reddit

reddit.com lets users post links to websites. This module lets you do
that from your perl scripts.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test

USAGE SUGGESTION

Since this module interacts with the reddit.com site in an automated
fashion, it makes it easy to become very rude to the community based
around that website. You are advised to not use it in a way that the
owners and operators of reddit.com would prefer you not. Just as you
would not pollute that community manually, please do not write a
program to do it for you.
